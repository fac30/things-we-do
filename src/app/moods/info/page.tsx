        <p>
          1. Urgent & Important: Do these tasks immediately (e.g., deadlines,
          emergencies).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Not Urgent but Important: Schedule these tasks (e.g., planning,
          exercise).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Urgent but Not Important: Delegate these tasks if possible (e.g.,
          interruptions).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Not Urgent & Not Important: Eliminate or minimize these tasks
          (e.g., distractions).
        </p>
        <h2>Breaking Tasks Down</h2>
        <p>
          Dealing with tasks them little by little, as they come up, especially
          those in Quadrants I and II, helps you reduce overwhelm, and ensure
          youâ€™re making continuous, meaningful progress towards what truly
          matters.
